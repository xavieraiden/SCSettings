Integrate comments from JSON file into gui.
	
	Print out the whole json file and replace data entries with text boxes? (Scan for :, for start of data entry, then scan for comma for end of data entry, then just replace the data entry print in the GUI with a text box?)
	Include Comments?

Make it not look like hot trash (Optional)

	Using Kivy Module (Apparently designed for touchscreens though)
	PyQt5 (Might be easier?)

Improve search bar

	Only display content that has the search term instead of greying everything else out (Probably hard, but best approach)
	Do what most text editors do and add the ability to quickly switch between entries that contain search terms (Probably easier)
