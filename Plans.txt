Integrate comments from JSON file into gui.
	
	Print out the whole json file and replace data entries with text boxes? (Scan for :, for start of data entry, then scan for comma for end of data entry, then just replace the data entry print in the GUI with a text box?)
	Include Comments?

Make it not look like hot trash (Optional)

	Using Kivy Module (Apparently designed for touchscreens though)
	PyQt5 (Might be easier?)
